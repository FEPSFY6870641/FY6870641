        What is Artificial Intelligence? "Artificial Intelligence (AI) - a term that was first used in 1956 by computer scientist 
        John McCarthy during a conference to discuss if machines could be made intelligent" <a href="#Bruun, E.P & Duka, A (2018)">(Rossi, 2016) cited in (Brunn, E.P. 
        & Duka, A. 2018).</a> In short, it's a type of technology that facilitates computers and machinery, which replicates human
        knowledge and does various activities such as problem solving, decision making and autonomy. In this article I will be
        portraying the uses of artificial intelligence in the workplace. By going in-depth on where it is already being used, 
        the benefits to businesses of using this piece of technology and on how is it useful for employment and managing workload.

    <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        As the world is developing and coming into a new era of technological advancement, we have seen a huge rise in the use
        of robotics with Artificial Intelligence (AI). From chat bots that businesses use to help guide their customers to AI 
        in self-driving cars, this is a revolutionary piece of technology.

        AI has been a rapidly progressing phenomenon. An example of this is AI being used in robots to do tedious task in the manufacturing
        industry. Figure 1, shows that robots using AI are able to perform tasks such as welding, assembling products and packaging with 
        greater accuracy and efficiency than humans <a href ="#Marr, BM(2024)">(Marr, 2024)</a>. This enables manufacturing companies to be cost effective as less mistakes
        are likely to occur. Moreover, the robots can work without any breaks <a href ="#WIRED (No date)">(WIRED, No Date)</a>. This allows the business to reduce costs in
        the long-term as they don't need to be paid wages, this permits them to increase production to meet customer demand. A study from 
        "MIT Technology Review Insights" took a survey of 300 manufactures that have begun working with AI. "64% are currently beginning to
        implement and are trying it out". Alternatively, "35% have put AI to use in their production". Respondents from this survey said 
        they would be boosting funding in AI in the foreseeable future <a href = "#MIT Technology Review Insights (2024)">(MIT Technology Review Insights, 2024).</a>

        Another industry that has seen a huge shift into AI is the car industry. Modern cars are packed full of technology. Figure 2, shows
        "Lane Assist", which makes sure the driver doesn't waver onto another lane, by scanning the road ahead and detecting the white lines 
        <a href ="#Euro NCAP (2018)">(Euro NCAP, 2018)</a>. Another feature is Adaptive cruise control, which uses radar technology to keep you a safe distance from the car 
        in front of you and being able to park by itself <a href = "#RAC(2018)">(RAC, 2018)</a>.The rapid use of AI in these systems will eventually lower the cost of producing
        these pieces of technology, making it accessible for more people <a href ="#Loureiro, S. M. C. et al (2021)">(Ivanov & Webster, 2019) cited in (Loureiro, S. M. C. et al, 2021)</a>.
        In recent years we have seen an increase of robot taxis being developed. These cars are programmed to operate in total autonomy. <a href = "#BBC(2024)">(BBC, 2024)</a>.
        There is a lot of data that AI needs to process and interpret such as cars, people, speed limit and obstacles in the road gathered from sensors
        called lidar and radar. The cameras around the vehicle can recognise and react to different obstructions in the surrounding environment, be
        able to take decisions on how to navigate and respond to different situations autonomously. <a href ="#Intra Journal Newsroom (2023)">(Infra Journal Newsroom, 2023)</a>

        <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
        One of the ethical considerations of robot taxis is that it will soon replace the jobs of the taxi drivers. <a href ="#Singh Dang, SSD (2022)">(Singh Dang, 2022)</a>. This can be
        concerning as their jobs could no longer exist in the future. This uncertainty can make drivers stress whilst working; this can reduce motivation, 
        hence causing less productivity. Moreover, it causes a shortage of taxi drivers as they may plan ahead and change their careers. This can be seen 
        in the manufacturing industry. A lot of production is now being automated due the cost and quality reasons. Artificial intelligence algorithms are 
        being used in quality control, where they are constantly monitoring and finding defects. Therefore, jobs involved in quality control may be replaced 
        by robots due to efficiency. However, by utilising automation in factories it has enhanced workplace safety by giving robots more dangerous aspects 
        of the job. <a href ="#Finio, MF, Downie, AD (2024)">(Finio, Downie, 2024)</a>

        <h3 id = "AI in the workplace">AI in the workplace</h3>
        <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
        The use of Artificial Intelligence can be seen as a tool, which helps employees to become more productive and not as something that will replace 
        jobs entirely. A great example of this is the use of AI in radiology <a href ="#The Economist (2018)">(The Economist, 2018)</a> .It can use deep learning to analyse areas of scans 
        and recognise traces - that humans were not able to identify. This can make diagnosis quicker and less expensive, which could save a patient's 
        life. This is especially important as radiology is costly and with these tools the prices will come down therefore, making it more accessible 
        for people. <a href ="#The Economist (2018)">(The Economist, 2018)</a>

        The use of artificial intelligence has created more job opportunities especially in the IT sector. Particularly in areas of development and creation.
        Moreover, there has been an increased demand in machine learning, engineers, data scientists that enable AI to work effectively. "By 2025 AI is 
        projected to create 97 million new job roles". <a href="#Gregg, IG (2024)">(Gregg, 2024)</a>.  The use of AI means that more jobs will arise in cyber security and ethics. This
        is because as AI learns more information users need to make sure that AI is following moral, social and ethical values. AI is also opening new 
        opportunities in different sectors. For example, Entrepreneurship in the business sector. It grants people to help start e-commerce businesses
        by using AI powered platforms, this allows them to reach customers across the globe. <a href ="#Iacoviello, MI (2023)">(Iacoviello, 2023)</a>

        <pre>
        In summary, the use of AI has replaced some jobs such as in manufacturing. <a href ="#Marr, BM(2024)">(Marr, 2024)</a>. But, overall the use of AI has supported many people 
        to work more efficiently in the workplace helping them to reduce the workload. For example, some areas of certain jobs can be dangerous or time
        consuming. If this is left for AI to do it will mean that employees will have more time to focus on other important aspects of work, such as 
        ensuring customer satisfaction and products being sent on the correct time. Consequently, facilitating workers to have more available time, 
        leading to increased innovation that can help businesses grow and generate more jobs. Furthermore, it has enabled more job opportunities in 
        the IT sector and encourages more entrepreneurship, which again leads to more jobs roles. <a href ="#Iacoviello, MI (2023)">(Iacoviello, 2023)</a>.
